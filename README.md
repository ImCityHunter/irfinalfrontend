# Introduction

All the food-related-website help people to find recipe for dish people want to make, but what if people have the ingredients and people do not know what to do with them? People may know how to make a good dish and buy all the ingredients needed for it, but people may not know what to do with all the left-over ingredients from multiple different meals. Thus, those left-over ingredients may eventually rot and be thrown out. In fact, United States wastes 30-40% of the food supplies every year. Hence, providing a website where users can insert ingredients; then website can give recommendations to users what meals they can possibly make with those ingredients.
